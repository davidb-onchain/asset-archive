If you have any questions on verision of Unity feel free to reach out and we will do our best to answer or you can checkout the wiki page about backward compatibility CIVIL-AI-SYSTEM is created to empower anyone to create scenes which feel lived in and alive. With the powerful suite of tooling provided you can bring your imagination to reality without diving into any code let alone complex code or graphs.Features- Easy Setup (In tool Getting Started checklist helper, population system)- Fast iteration and design- Quiet Failing Designed (Errors logged but the system keeps running)- Performance Optimised (100s of agents)- Detailed Animation Controller- Work Behaviour System- Need Behaviour System- Deep Item System (interaction can cause designed side effect)- Layered Customisation (Create different feeling regions, Animations, Characters)- Ownership System & Visual Item System (Agents have a concept of what is theirs, agents can carry, store, and interact with items in many ways)Documentation | DiscordBuild Your Behaviours iterativelyThe many tools provided in CIVIL-AI-SYSTEM breakdown the many aspects of making belivable scenes into manageable, understandable, and controllable sections.- Create work behaviours with ease by using real life comparisons not some abstract system.- Define need behaviours which add extra depth and flavour to your agents.- Add animations with the built in animation controller, giving visual cues and details- Provide more than one way to complete tasks, giving more robustness- And so much more!Easy Scene SetupBuilding a city takes a long time, populating it with life even longer. Not with CIVIL-AI-SYSTEM, denote your houses, workplaces, and items. Add your population region in with your pool of characters and the system takes care of the rest! No need to place every single citizen by hand. However, if you do want to (place all or a few) you can (look into bespoke agents if interested).Evolving Product and WikiTools can always be improved and streamlined. Experience updates which provide meaningful additions at no extra cost and are driven by user feedback and experience. Substantial updates have included; reworking of item systems, the need feature and many, many more. Checkout our roadmap. Every addition has also been backward compatible meaning no fuss in upgrading, giving you peace of mind.World Class SupportNever alone when using CIVIL-AI-SYSTEM, any problems feel free to reach out on discord and it will get sorted and advice will be given if wanted. The wiki also provides guides, interfaces and a host of other useful features to help you get the most out of this tool.Endless Integrations & ExtensionsAs it been developed with best practices it is easy to extend and expand at ease! Most systems have interfaces and separated concerns meaning easy switching out of parts. Gives you the user the freedom to extend and change as you see fit with minimum merge conflicts between versions. There are also supported integrations out of the box.Supported Integrations (No Code changes)- A* Pathfinding Project Pro/Free- Agents NavigationEasy to Use With (Small amount of coding needed)- RPG Builder- Emerald AI- Behavior Designer - Behavior Trees for EveryoneFAQ1.What AI implantation is this?CIVIL-AI-SYSTEM is a unique spin a few different pre-existing AI solutions used in AAA games. The main focus is empowering anyone to make day-to-day AI behaviours which believably bring your worlds and scenes to life quickly.2. Is this just GOAP?No, it is not! This is asked a lot, this system does share some similarities with it and does borrow some ideas but this is not true GOAP. This has its own ideas and processes along with other tooling to help you develop your scenes quickly (think auto population for example)3. Does this cover combat?CIVIL-AI-SYSTEM does not cover any form of combat and is not planned to, the idea of this product is to allow you to give your characters depth easily and effortlessly in the scene. There are a ton of methods and products that do exist to cover combat on the Asset Store which this can be implemented with and should be no hassle due to the system being designed in a modular way. With a built in pause feature and a single point of entry for the logic of CIVIL-AI-SYSTEM to be called you can easily enable and disable it at runtime with ease.4. Can I have custom animations?Yes, it fully supports actions having their own animations and more! How it works is each lowest level condition can be provided a reference to an Animation Clip and this will be played for as long as the action is being performed. This is done by the Animation Controller having a ‘Dynamic’ field which is overwritten. There are also a set of core animations which can be changed on the fly based on requirements.5. What Support can I expect while using the product?There is an active discord and email support for this product, I’m UK based (GMT) so there might be some delays in getting back to you depending on time. Most problems and questions are responded to within a few hours.6. Is this package finished or can I except updates?This product is in active development and is planned to offer more than what is currently for no extra fee. No code breaking changes are planned and if are needed will be documented on how to upgrade and retain as much information as possible and will only be done as a last resort. With updates there is a Release Candidate Process which involves manual testing as well as automated testing to provide the best quality possible. There is also a roadmap of the upcoming features.7. Can I have Agents pick up items?Yes, you can! There is already an item system included, items can be set to be in use, can be picked up (placed on the Agent on a chosen transform), spawned in, replaced and interacting with one item can enable another with more to come.8.Can I easily add/change other systems to this?This is a definite yes! Tons of people have already used this tool with many different systems, from navigation to other AI solutions! Everything should be easy to connect up as CIVIL-AI-SYSTEM is designed with modern principles such as single responsibility meaning systems are owned by one system making the change simple!**PLEASE NOTE - MUST READ BEFORE BUYING**This package does not include any animations, models or textures/materials except for some basic Unity Starter Projects ones, these are used under the Unity Companion License. It does include an animation controller and is setup ready for animations to be plugged in. Assets which are not included but used in marketing are for demonstrational purposes and used to give a sense of how the tool works.PerformanceThis is a vitailly important aspect of this tool and has plans to be improved in the future. Using the Unity profile tools running the 'Demo_Main' scene from 'POLYGON Pirates - Low Poly 3D Art by Synty' in 4K and spawning in 40 agents all starting work at the same time the CPU main thread usage peaked at 12% usage with a low of 9%. With the Use of the 'Region' System there is a easy way to manage groups of agents allowing the ability to enable and disable sections of the scene to improve performance so more agents could be displayed with limited impact on performance if they are spread out throughout your scene.In frame rate terms it was an average 75fps.Testing within Performance test scenes (these are included in the project). On my PC with test conditions kept as close as possible through multiple runs came out with the followingPerformance Test Scene (This is 300 agents spread out with items being spawned and deleted) - Avergage 139.7 FPSPerformance Test Scene II (This is 52 agents densely populated with items being spawned and deleted) - Avergage 160.9 FPS.Please keep in mind these could be different on different devices.If you do come across performance issue, please don't hesitant to reach out and we will endeavour to help you out.AnimationsThese can't be added to the package due to licensing rules but Mixamo provides a range of free use animations (for commercial and personal use) which works great with this tool.Mixamo (recommanded steps can be found on the wiki)SetupSetting up the system is easily done as shown in this video or shown in the steps below.Import CIVIL-AI-SYSTEMOpen the menu CIVIL-AI-SYSTEM (Along the top) -> Help ->  Getting StartedFrom here in a new scene you will be provided with a check list which you can follow with ease and updates as you go",

      "description": "Shader for cheaply rendering blob shadow volumes.Adding simple rectangular or circular shadows is very easy with this asset! The shadow volume geometry can be moved, rotated, and scaled. Just drop the material onto a cube or sphere mesh, place it in the world, and adjust the color, sharpness, and intensity as needed. For dynamic objects, you can position it with a simple script or constraint. The shadows can be useful even in situations when full shadows are enabled but a little bit of cheap extra occlusion is desired. The material can be GPU instanced, but static and dynamic batching do not work, because batching removes transformation information necessary for the shader to function.The primary advantage this asset has over the standard Unity projector is that the projector will re-render all of the objects it affects, which can potentially increase the number of draw calls and overall cost of a scene dramatically, especially if there are multiple objects casting shadows on multiple environment objects, or the objects receiving the shadows are large or complex. The FVBS shader doesn't suffer from this issue, and will have the same cost regardless of the complexity of the scene being shadowed.Note: For the shader to work, there must be a depth texture enabled on the camera, either in the pipeline asset for the URP, or with an included script for Builtin. If the depth texture is not already enabled in your project you will see an increase in draw calls due to Unity needing to render the depth pass. If draw calls are the primary bottleneck this asset is likely not the right solution.Multiple Renderers: Builtin and URP are both supported. Works in forward and deferred pipelines.Highly Optimized: Very simple transparent shader, extremely quick to render. Suitable for mobile and VR applications. One draw call per shadow without GPU instancing, or one draw call per shadow material with GPU instancing enabled.Stable and Simple: The only scripting needed is to position the shadow volume, no special receiver scripts or render textures required.Fully Editable: Versions of the shader for Unity's Shader Graph as well as for Amplify Shader Editor are included, depending on the renderer.Various Uses: The shadow color can be set to anything, so the volumes could have multiple uses beyond shadowing: a bright color could be used as a very simple fake light.",

Thanks to a Quad-Tree generation structure, it's blazing fast! No loading screens, no visible borders, just one continuous, immersive terrain.Create Worlds with Ease: Thanks to an Intuitive Graph Editor, you will be able to generate vast and interesting landscapes with just a few clicks. Start Your Game with Pre-Defined Samples: Experiment with ready-to-use sample scenes included in the package. Use them as inspiration or a foundation for your own unique worlds.Bake Terrains to use Externally: Bake terrain data into textures and export them to use in Blender, Houdini, or other tools. You can also store them as Unity Terrain Data and tweak them as you see fit.Your Style, Your Workflow: Infinite Lands adapts to you, not the other way around. Its component-based post-processing system ensures you can use your own assets, workflows, and artistic vision without losing any core features. Are you missing something? Just let me know so we can get it working. Procedural Asset Placement: Altought manual placement of objects is supported, Infinite Lands thrieves in the procedural landscape.

Packages feature a dependency system which can be used to enforce a specific execution order.Before you purchase uLua, feel free to check out the following resources:uLua Documentation: The full documentation, including a tutorial on how to use the toolkit.Note: You must install the Unity MoonSharp plugin before you can use uLua.uLua consists of the following main scripts:uLua.API: Class that implements an event handling system and a script execution framework.uLua.LuaExposeSequencer: MonoBehaviour script which exposes other MonoBehaviours to Lua as configured in the inspector.uLua.LuaMonoBehaviour: MonoBehaviour script which exposes its instances to Lua.

Use spring joints to simulate a character attached to a rope. Use fixed joints to attach physical items to the ragdoll animator rig.✍ Extra Features APIThe plugin comes with an \"Extra Features\" API which allows you to apply custom scripts in Ragdoll Animator update loops without modifying the core code. This enables many cool behaviors, and you will find more than 25 extra features included in the release version.⚙️ Equipables APIThanks to this API, you can attach helmeds / hand items to the ragdoll character, including their physics, and also apply custom heavyness of the items to influence the physical animation of the skeleton.🔧 Helpful Utility ComponentsRagdoll Animator 2 comes with additional components, like Magnet Points: for rigidbody manipulation, and a Joint Chains Generator / Single Animated Chain, which you can find really useful for designing custom physical interations.⌛ Great PerformanceThanks to the plugin's fidelity, you can switch On and Off features you don't need to save performance. You can constantly preview cost of each Ragdoll Animator within the inspector window by hitting green debug icon.

      "description": "Create and shape curvy roads, connect them to intersections, and calculate the shortest Path to the goal! Useful for minimaps, or vehicle AI.As this package is not a collection of models and textures, but a tool, SRP compatibility is irrelevant. You are intended to use your own models, however, the package comes with some samples that use the Built-in Render Pipeline.This package allows you to create custom roads in any modelling software, and tile them along a custom bezier curve. The curves are easy to manipulate, and can be connected to intersections. This package includes tools for moving and rotating points along the road, as well as a freestyle spline tool that you might know from image manipulation programs.Once you're done with your roads, you have a graph with correct edge weights which can then be used to plot the shortest path from any point to any other point. This path can be displayed on a minimap, or used in any other way you can come up with.The package includes premade roads and intersections, but you can make your own, as described in the documentation.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ MIGRATION TO VERSION 2 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~MAKE A BACK-UP OF YOUR PROJECT TO BE SAFEDelete the entire folder in `Assets/Barmetler`.This will temporarily result in invalid references in your project, which is fine for now.Update and import the new Asset, which will now reside in the `Packages` folder.If you have not used any pre-made roads, materials, prefabs, etc, you are done here. If you have, continue with step 5.Open the package manager under Window>Package Manager.From the drop-down in the top left, where it says \"Unity Registry\" or \"My Assets\", etc. select \"In Project\".\"Road System\" should show up there, click on itNavigate to the \"Samples\" tab and import the sample that is there. It contains the Textures, Materials, Meshes, and Prefabs that were previously in the \"Demo\" folder, as that is how UPM packages work. These samples maintain the same GUIDs as previously, meaning that instantiated prefabs in your scene will be fine again.Advantages: UPM packages have a standardized format and are better suited to tools. They can also reside outside your project, if you want. Their dependencies to other packages from the Unity Registry are automatically installed.Explanation: Unity Assets refer to other Assets by their GUID. The GUID of an asset is specified in its corresponding `*.meta` file.For a seamless migration, the GUIDs of the scripts, prefabs, materials, etc that now reside in `Packages` maintain the same GUIDs of the ones in the `Assets` folder.However, two assets with the same GUID can not exist, which Unity \"solves\" by simply generating new GUIDs, keeping the link between your existing assets. This will break the link between your assets and the ones in the `Packages` folder.Therefore, it is very important that you DELETE the assets in the `Assets` folder before re-importing the new version, the GUIDs will stay the same. This was the easiest way to facilitate the migration.As long as no GUIDs change, the migration should have no side effects.As stated before, MAKE A BACK-UP OF YOUR PROJECT TO BE SAFE.FeaturesCreate and shape roads easilyUse and model of your liking for the roadsPathfinding using A*Smooth line generationAPI is easy to understand and useDocumentationhttps://www.barmetler.com/projects/road-system",

      "description": "This asset is a sample of Ushi Arcade Car Physics.The demo scene is made with the built-in render pipeline, but the script itself does not have any dependencies on a specific render pipeline, so it can be used with any render pipeline.WebGL DemoEmailThis asset is a sample of a small part of Ushi Arcade Car Physics. It is perfect for those who need a simple car behavior.All source code is accessible. We do not make the source code secret by making it a dll, which is common in free versions. It is highly extensible and is suitable as a base for creating original car behavior.The paid version of Ushi Arcade Car Physics comes with many times more scripts than this asset. It comes with a car controller with a gasoline-powered drivetrain, various cameras, AI, effects, and a wide variety of other scripts. If you like this asset, please consider purchasing the paid version.The input uses the old Input Manager. To continue using it, you need to switch Project Settings > Player > Active Input Handling to Input Manager (Old). I plan to migrate to the Input System in the near future.Because WheelCollider is not used, it cannot stay completely still on the slope. This is a problem with the physics engine and there is nothing that can be done about it. It is by design.",
