If you have any questions on verision of Unity feel free to reach out and we will do our best to answer or you can checkout the wiki page about backward compatibility CIVIL-AI-SYSTEM is created to empower anyone to create scenes which feel lived in and alive. With the powerful suite of tooling provided you can bring your imagination to reality without diving into any code let alone complex code or graphs.Features- Easy Setup (In tool Getting Started checklist helper, population system)- Fast iteration and design- Quiet Failing Designed (Errors logged but the system keeps running)- Performance Optimised (100s of agents)- Detailed Animation Controller- Work Behaviour System- Need Behaviour System- Deep Item System (interaction can cause designed side effect)- Layered Customisation (Create different feeling regions, Animations, Characters)- Ownership System & Visual Item System (Agents have a concept of what is theirs, agents can carry, store, and interact with items in many ways)Documentation | DiscordBuild Your Behaviours iterativelyThe many tools provided in CIVIL-AI-SYSTEM breakdown the many aspects of making belivable scenes into manageable, understandable, and controllable sections.- Create work behaviours with ease by using real life comparisons not some abstract system.- Define need behaviours which add extra depth and flavour to your agents.- Add animations with the built in animation controller, giving visual cues and details- Provide more than one way to complete tasks, giving more robustness- And so much more!Easy Scene SetupBuilding a city takes a long time, populating it with life even longer. Not with CIVIL-AI-SYSTEM, denote your houses, workplaces, and items. Add your population region in with your pool of characters and the system takes care of the rest! No need to place every single citizen by hand. However, if you do want to (place all or a few) you can (look into bespoke agents if interested).Evolving Product and WikiTools can always be improved and streamlined. Experience updates which provide meaningful additions at no extra cost and are driven by user feedback and experience. Substantial updates have included; reworking of item systems, the need feature and many, many more. Checkout our roadmap. Every addition has also been backward compatible meaning no fuss in upgrading, giving you peace of mind.World Class SupportNever alone when using CIVIL-AI-SYSTEM, any problems feel free to reach out on discord and it will get sorted and advice will be given if wanted. The wiki also provides guides, interfaces and a host of other useful features to help you get the most out of this tool.Endless Integrations & ExtensionsAs it been developed with best practices it is easy to extend and expand at ease! Most systems have interfaces and separated concerns meaning easy switching out of parts. Gives you the user the freedom to extend and change as you see fit with minimum merge conflicts between versions. There are also supported integrations out of the box.Supported Integrations (No Code changes)- A* Pathfinding Project Pro/Free- Agents NavigationEasy to Use With (Small amount of coding needed)- RPG Builder- Emerald AI- Behavior Designer - Behavior Trees for EveryoneFAQ1.What AI implantation is this?CIVIL-AI-SYSTEM is a unique spin a few different pre-existing AI solutions used in AAA games. The main focus is empowering anyone to make day-to-day AI behaviours which believably bring your worlds and scenes to life quickly.2. Is this just GOAP?No, it is not! This is asked a lot, this system does share some similarities with it and does borrow some ideas but this is not true GOAP. This has its own ideas and processes along with other tooling to help you develop your scenes quickly (think auto population for example)3. Does this cover combat?CIVIL-AI-SYSTEM does not cover any form of combat and is not planned to, the idea of this product is to allow you to give your characters depth easily and effortlessly in the scene. There are a ton of methods and products that do exist to cover combat on the Asset Store which this can be implemented with and should be no hassle due to the system being designed in a modular way. With a built in pause feature and a single point of entry for the logic of CIVIL-AI-SYSTEM to be called you can easily enable and disable it at runtime with ease.4. Can I have custom animations?Yes, it fully supports actions having their own animations and more! How it works is each lowest level condition can be provided a reference to an Animation Clip and this will be played for as long as the action is being performed. This is done by the Animation Controller having a ‘Dynamic’ field which is overwritten. There are also a set of core animations which can be changed on the fly based on requirements.5. What Support can I expect while using the product?There is an active discord and email support for this product, I’m UK based (GMT) so there might be some delays in getting back to you depending on time. Most problems and questions are responded to within a few hours.6. Is this package finished or can I except updates?This product is in active development and is planned to offer more than what is currently for no extra fee. No code breaking changes are planned and if are needed will be documented on how to upgrade and retain as much information as possible and will only be done as a last resort. With updates there is a Release Candidate Process which involves manual testing as well as automated testing to provide the best quality possible. There is also a roadmap of the upcoming features.7. Can I have Agents pick up items?Yes, you can! There is already an item system included, items can be set to be in use, can be picked up (placed on the Agent on a chosen transform), spawned in, replaced and interacting with one item can enable another with more to come.8.Can I easily add/change other systems to this?This is a definite yes! Tons of people have already used this tool with many different systems, from navigation to other AI solutions! Everything should be easy to connect up as CIVIL-AI-SYSTEM is designed with modern principles such as single responsibility meaning systems are owned by one system making the change simple!**PLEASE NOTE - MUST READ BEFORE BUYING**This package does not include any animations, models or textures/materials except for some basic Unity Starter Projects ones, these are used under the Unity Companion License. It does include an animation controller and is setup ready for animations to be plugged in. Assets which are not included but used in marketing are for demonstrational purposes and used to give a sense of how the tool works.PerformanceThis is a vitailly important aspect of this tool and has plans to be improved in the future. Using the Unity profile tools running the 'Demo_Main' scene from 'POLYGON Pirates - Low Poly 3D Art by Synty' in 4K and spawning in 40 agents all starting work at the same time the CPU main thread usage peaked at 12% usage with a low of 9%. With the Use of the 'Region' System there is a easy way to manage groups of agents allowing the ability to enable and disable sections of the scene to improve performance so more agents could be displayed with limited impact on performance if they are spread out throughout your scene.In frame rate terms it was an average 75fps.Testing within Performance test scenes (these are included in the project). On my PC with test conditions kept as close as possible through multiple runs came out with the followingPerformance Test Scene (This is 300 agents spread out with items being spawned and deleted) - Avergage 139.7 FPSPerformance Test Scene II (This is 52 agents densely populated with items being spawned and deleted) - Avergage 160.9 FPS.Please keep in mind these could be different on different devices.If you do come across performance issue, please don't hesitant to reach out and we will endeavour to help you out.AnimationsThese can't be added to the package due to licensing rules but Mixamo provides a range of free use animations (for commercial and personal use) which works great with this tool.Mixamo (recommanded steps can be found on the wiki)SetupSetting up the system is easily done as shown in this video or shown in the steps below.Import CIVIL-AI-SYSTEMOpen the menu CIVIL-AI-SYSTEM (Along the top) -> Help ->  Getting StartedFrom here in a new scene you will be provided with a check list which you can follow with ease and updates as you go",
