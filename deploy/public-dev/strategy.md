Of course. Based on your progress and the excellent technical specifications in the `docs/` and `cms/` directories, here is a breakdown of what it would take to get your project up and running on DigitalOcean for client review.

The strategy described in your documentation is solid and aligns well with modern best practices. It centers on containerization with Docker Compose for the backend, provisioning infrastructure with Terraform, and deploying a decoupled Next.js frontend.

### Proposed DigitalOcean Architecture

Hereâ€™s a target architecture that builds upon your existing plans:

1.  **Backend Services (CMS, Workers, ArchiveBox)**:
    *   **Compute**: A single **DigitalOcean Droplet** (e.g., a General Purpose Droplet with 2 vCPUs and 4GB RAM as a starting point). This Droplet will run Docker and orchestrate all the backend containers using your `docker-compose.yml` file.
    *   **Orchestration**: Use the `docker-compose.yml` from `cms/README.md` as a base for the production environment.

2.  **Database (PostgreSQL)**:
    *   **Recommendation**: Use a **DigitalOcean Managed PostgreSQL Database**.
    *   **Reasoning**: While running PostgreSQL in a Docker container is great for development, a managed database simplifies production immensely. It handles backups, scaling, and security automatically, which is more reliable and saves operational overhead. You would connect to it from your Strapi container via a secure private connection (VPC).

3.  **File Storage (Strapi Media Library)**:
    *   **Recommendation**: Use **DigitalOcean Spaces** (S3-compatible object storage).
    *   **Reasoning**: Your `cms/README.md` correctly notes that the local file storage provider is not suitable for production, especially if you scale beyond a single server. By installing the Strapi S3 provider plugin (`@strapi/provider-upload-aws-s3`) and configuring it to point to your DO Spaces bucket, you get a scalable, durable, and cost-effective solution for media assets. This also aligns with the plan in `content-server.md` to use Spaces for backups.

4.  **Frontend (Next.js App)**:
    *   **Recommendation**: Deploy using **DigitalOcean App Platform**.
    *   **Reasoning**: App Platform is designed specifically for applications like Next.js. You can connect it directly to your GitHub repository, and it will automatically handle building, deploying, and serving the application. It also provides HTTPS, custom domains, and environment variable management out of the box. This is significantly simpler than managing a Node.js process and a reverse proxy on the Droplet yourself.

This architecture would look something like this:

```

### Phased Execution Plan to Deploy on DigitalOcean

Here is a step-by-step plan to get from your current local setup to a production-ready environment on DigitalOcean.

#### Phase 1: Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)

As recommended in `content-server.md`, the first step is to define your cloud infrastructure in code.

1.  **Create a Terraform Project**: In a new `infra/` directory, set up the DigitalOcean provider.
2.  **Define Resources**:
    *   A **VPC Network** to allow your services to communicate privately and securely.
    *   A **DigitalOcean Droplet** for the backend services.
    *   A **Managed PostgreSQL Database** cluster.
    *   A **Spaces Bucket** for media uploads.
    *   A **Cloud Firewall** to restrict access (e.g., only allow SSH from your IP, HTTP/S from the world, and database access only from within the VPC).
    *   **DNS Records** for your domain to point to the App Platform and potentially the Droplet.
3.  **Provision**: Run `terraform apply` to create all the resources. Securely store the outputted database credentials and Spaces keys.

#### Phase 2: Backend Deployment (Docker on Droplet)

1.  **Prepare the Droplet**:
    *   SSH into the new Droplet.
    *   Install Docker and Docker Compose using a simple setup script or a tool like Ansible as suggested in the docs.
2.  **Configure Strapi for Production**:
    *   Update `cms/apps/cms/config/database.ts` to use the managed PostgreSQL connection details.
    *   Install and configure the Strapi S3 upload provider to use your new Spaces bucket.
3.  **Deploy the Stack**:
    *   Create a production `.env` file on the server with all the necessary secrets (database credentials, API keys, Spaces keys). Do *not* commit this file.
    *   Copy your `docker-compose.yml` to the server, ensuring it's configured for production (e.g., using pre-built images, not mounting local code volumes for the application itself).
    *   Run `docker compose up -d` to launch the entire backend stack.

#### Phase 3: Frontend Deployment (App Platform)

1.  **Create a New App**: In the DigitalOcean dashboard, create a new App Platform application and point it to your `frontend/` directory in your GitHub repository.
2.  **Configure the Service**:
    *   App Platform will detect the Next.js app.
    *   Add the production environment variables, most importantly `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_URL`, pointing to the domain name for your backend Droplet.
3.  **Deploy**: Trigger the first deployment. App Platform will build the Next.js application and deploy it.

#### Phase 4: Finalization and Documentation

1.  **Set up CI/CD**: Create GitHub Actions workflows to automatically deploy the frontend to App Platform and update the backend containers on the Droplet whenever you push to your main branch.
2.  **Configure Backups**: Confirm that your Managed Database has Point-in-Time-Recovery enabled and set up a lifecycle policy on your Spaces bucket for backups.
3.  **Document**: The `docs/site-deployment.md` file is currently empty. I recommend using it to document the production environment setup, including URLs, IPs, and operational procedures (how to SSH, how to check logs, etc.). I can help you create this document.

By following this plan, you can create a robust, scalable, and manageable production environment on DigitalOcean that is perfect for sharing with your client and for the future growth of the application. 

### Secure and Automated Implementation Strategy

To translate the proposed architecture into a live system, we will adopt a GitOps methodology. This means your Git repository will be the single source of truth for both your application code and your infrastructure. This strategy will support two distinct environments:
*   **Development (`dev`)**: A public testing environment for client review, deployed automatically from the `develop` branch.
*   **Production (`prod`)**: The final, live environment for end-users, deployed automatically from the `main` branch.

The primary goal is to create a workflow where infrastructure changes are proposed, reviewed, and deployed with the same rigor as application code, driven by automation to ensure consistency and security across both environments.

#### 1. Foundational Setup: Security First

Before writing any infrastructure code, we must establish a secure foundation.

*   **Terraform State Backend**: The first step is to create a single, private DigitalOcean Spaces bucket. This bucket will be exclusively used to store the Terraform state files for all environments. Using a remote, private bucket is non-negotiable as it provides state locking to prevent team conflicts and encrypts sensitive data at rest. Terraform Workspaces will ensure that the `dev` and `prod` states are kept isolated within this bucket.
*   **Least-Privilege API Tokens**: Create dedicated DigitalOcean API tokens for each environment (e.g., one for `dev`, one for `prod`). Each token should have only the permissions necessary to manage the resources in its respective environment. These tokens must be stored securely as secrets in your CI/CD system (e.g., GitHub Actions Secrets like `DO_DEV` and `DO_PROD`) and never committed to the repository.
*   **Local Developer Setup**: Developers should authenticate to DigitalOcean via the CLI or by setting the secret token as an environment variable (`DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN`) on their local machines. This prevents the need to hardcode credentials.

#### 2. Code Structure and Repository Management

The `infra/` directory will be organized for clarity and maintainability.

*   **Functional File Organization**: We will split Terraform configurations into logical files (`database.tf`, `network.tf`, `droplet.tf`, etc.). This makes the infrastructure easier to understand and manage than a single monolithic file.
*   **Isolating Variables**: All configurable values (like region, Droplet size, or image name) will be defined in `variables.tf`. This file serves as the "API" for our infrastructure, clearly defining what can be customized.
*   **Preventing Secret Leaks**: The `.gitignore` file within the `infra/` directory will be configured to explicitly ignore all Terraform state files (`*.tfstate`), plan cache files, and variable definition files (`*.tfvars`). This is a critical safeguard against accidentally committing secrets or state information to Git.

#### 3. The Automation Workflow: CI/CD with GitHub Actions

Automation is key to a secure and repeatable process. We will create workflows that respond to your branching strategy.

*   **The "Plan" Workflow (On Pull Request)**: When a developer opens a pull request targeting either the `develop` or `main` branch, a GitHub Action will automatically trigger. It will initialize Terraform, select the appropriate workspace (`dev` or `prod`), validate the code, and run a `terraform plan`. The resulting plan will be posted as a comment on the pull request, allowing for mandatory peer review of all infrastructure changes against the correct environment.
*   **The "Apply" Workflow (On Merge)**:
    *   **To Development**: When a pull request is merged into the `develop` branch, a GitHub Action will trigger. It will select the `dev` workspace and run `terraform apply`, deploying changes to the development environment.
    *   **To Production**: Once a pull request is reviewed and merged into the `main` branch, a second GitHub Action will trigger. It will select the `prod` workspace and run `terraform apply`, deploying the changes to the live production environment.

This process ensures changes are always tested in a dedicated `dev` environment before being promoted to `prod`.

#### 4. Managing Multiple Environments

To test changes safely and manage configuration differences, we will use a combination of Terraform Workspaces and environment-specific variable files. This approach allows us to use a single set of infrastructure code to manage both environments.

*   **Terraform Workspaces**: We will use two workspaces: `dev` and `prod`. Terraform will use these to maintain completely separate state files for each environment within the same backend bucket, ensuring that a change intended for `dev` can never accidentally affect `prod`.
*   **Environment-Specific Configurations**: Each environment will have different needs (e.g., a smaller Droplet for `dev`, a larger one for `prod`). We will manage these differences using dedicated variable files: `dev.tfvars` and `prod.tfvars`.
*   **CI/CD Integration**: The GitHub Actions workflow will be responsible for selecting the correct workspace and loading the appropriate `.tfvars` file based on the target branch (`develop` for `dev`, `main` for `prod`). It will also use the corresponding secrets (e.g., `DO_DEV_TOKEN` for the `dev` environment), ensuring full isolation.
