# --- Configuration ---
# Description: This script restores a PostgreSQL database from a backup file
# created by the backup.sh script.
#
# Instructions:
# 1. Update the CONTAINER_NAME, DB_USER, and DB_NAME variables below.
# 2. Make the script executable: chmod +x restore.sh
# 3. Run it, passing the path to the backup file as an argument:
#    ./restore.sh ../backups/backup-your-db-name-YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.dump

# --- Variables to Configure ---
CONTAINER_NAME="assetarchive-postgres" # The name of your running Postgres container
DB_USER="strapi"                   # The username for the database
DB_NAME="strapi"                   # The database to restore into

# --- Script Logic (No need to edit below this line) ---

# 1. Check for backup file argument
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
    echo "‚ùå Error: No backup file specified."
    echo "Usage: $0 <path_to_backup_file.dump>"
    exit 1

    echo "‚ùå Error: Backup file not found at '${BACKUP_FILE}'"
    exit 1
fi

echo "Starting PostgreSQL restore for container '${CONTAINER_NAME}'..."
echo "--------------------------------------------------"

# 2. Validate the backup file BEFORE any destructive actions
echo "Validating backup file integrity..."
if ! cat "${BACKUP_FILE}" | docker exec -i "${CONTAINER_NAME}" pg_restore -l > /dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "‚ùå FATAL ERROR: Backup file '${BACKUP_FILE}' is corrupted or invalid."

# 3. Confirmation prompt
echo "üö® WARNING: This is a destructive operation."

# 4. Terminate all active connections to the database
# This is necessary because we can't drop a database that has active sessions.
# We connect to the default 'postgres' database to execute this command.
echo "Terminating all connections to '${DB_NAME}'..."

# 5. Drop and recreate the database to ensure a clean restore
echo "Dropping existing database '${DB_NAME}'..."
docker exec -t "${CONTAINER_NAME}" dropdb -U "${DB_USER}" --if-exists "${DB_NAME}"
echo "‚úîÔ∏è Database dropped."

echo "Creating new database '${DB_NAME}'..."
docker exec -t "${CONTAINER_NAME}" createdb -U "${DB_USER}" "${DB_NAME}"

# 6. Execute pg_restore
# We pipe the backup file into the container and use pg_restore.
echo "Restoring database from '${BACKUP_FILE}'..."

# 7. Final confirmation
